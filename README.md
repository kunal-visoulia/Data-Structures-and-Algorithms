## Arrays v/s ArrayLists
1. An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java. Therefore array members are accessed using [], while ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and modify them. 
2. Array can contain both primitive data types as well as objects of a class depending on the definition of the array. However, ArrayList only supports object entries, not the primitive data types.
3. ArrayList has O(n) time complexity for arbitrary indices of add/remove, but O(1) for the operation at the end of the list.
LinkedList has O(n) time complexity for arbitrary indices of add/remove, but O(1) for operations at end/beginning of the List.

## Searching Algorithms
### Binary Search
- Data structure	            : Array
- Worst-case performance	    : O(log n)
- Best-case performance	      : O(1)
- Average performance	        : O(log n)
- Worst-case space complexity	: O(1)

## Sorting Algorithms
## Quick Sort


## What are BFS and DFS for Binary Tree?
A Tree is typically traversed in two ways:

Breadth First Traversal (Or Level Order Traversal)
Depth First Traversals
Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
