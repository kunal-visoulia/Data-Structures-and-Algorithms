## Coding Challenge 6:
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.<br/>
Follow Up: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

Complexity to achieve<br/>
Time Complexity: O(n)<br/>
Space Complexity: O(n)<br/>

## Challenge: 8
Write an efficient program that returns a list of string that matches the start of the given input.

For Example:
Given: 
List: { “contribute”, “geeks”, “geek”, “geekiest”, “ide”, “practice”}
Input: gee
Should return: {“geeks”, “geek”, “geekiest”}

Follow Up: How would you implement that code, without using Linear Search?

## Challenge: 11
Given an array n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Extra Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Input: [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]<br/>
Output:[ [-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2] ]
